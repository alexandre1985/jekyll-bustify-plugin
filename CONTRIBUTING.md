# CONTRIBUTING

Anyone is free to contribute.  

The goal for this plugin is to be bug free. It already does the job, but there are situations where it needs to run `jekyll build` twice in order to fulfil the job.

I will need you to specify what your contribution is achieving and why you have done it.

Peace
